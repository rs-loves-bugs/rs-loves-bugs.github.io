burp-browser-profiles is a small shell script utility that will help you make better use of the embedded browser that comes by default with Burp. This is heavily inspired by [PwnFox](https://github.com/yeswehack/PwnFox), I wanted to have a similar tool to use with the embedded Burp browser

## Features:

-allows you to create and maintain multiple Burp browser profiles

-allows you to run multiple Burp browser instances at the same time with different profiles

-allows you to specify a different proxy server for every Burp browser instance you have running

-allows you to specify a custom user agent for every Burp browser instance you have running

-allows you to differentiate the profiles between them with a different color used for the Burp browser window frame(blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, magenta, pink)

-allows you in Burp to highlight with the same color the request from that specific profile(this feature requires installing a Burp extension)

# Instalation:

burp-browser-profiles was tested on Mac and Linux and will work with either Burp Professional or Burp Community Edition

```
git clone https://github.com/rs-loves-bugs/burp-browser-profiles
```
```
cd burp-browser-profiles
```

To color highlight the requests in Burp please install either one of these two extensions:

PwnFox - [link to jar file](https://github.com/yeswehack/PwnFox/releases/download/v1.0.3/PwnFox.jar), highlighting enabled by default

Sharpener - [link to BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/3c5025b0e19d419a8f339ee0c30391dd), then enable the highlighter(Sharpener -> Global Settings -> Supported Capabilities -> PwnFox Highlighter)

Create and run a profile named testing:
```
./burp-browser-profiles -P testing
```

List available profiles to use:

./burp-browser-profiles -P testing
