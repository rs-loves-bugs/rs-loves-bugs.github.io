In april I recorded myself solving the monthly Intigriti challenge, some parts from the recordings got featured in a video on the official Intigriti Youtube channel.

I have to say, it is surprisingly dificult to narate and record yourself trying to figure out a vulnerability :) 

Thank you Intigriti for the opportunity!
